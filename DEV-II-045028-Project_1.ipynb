The findings presented in this report aim to enhance the understanding of the dataset and contribute to strategic decision-making for improving passenger experience and optimizing flight operations.\n",
    "1. Distribution of Passengers with Age:\n",
    "We categorized passengers into four groups: seniors, adults, youth, and children. The analysis revealed that seniors constitute the largest passenger group. This insight can guide efforts to tailor services and amenities to the needs of different age segments.\n",
    "2. Distribution of Flight Statuses:\n",
    "A pie chart illustrated the distribution of flight statuses, showing that the statuses \"Cancelled,\" \"Delayed,\" and \"On Time\" exhibit similar proportions. No significant outliers were observed, emphasizing the importance of consistently managing all flight statuses.\n",
    "3. Top 5 Continents and Countries with the Most Visits:\n",
    "The analysis identified North America as the most visited continent, with the USA being the top country. This information is crucial for resource allocation and marketing strategies, focusing on regions with high passenger traffic.\n",
    "4. Top 10 Nationalities Traveling from Flights:\n",
